Psychometric models for multiple attempts.

This is an incomplete R package containing code developed for this paper:

  Bergner, Y., Choi, I., Castellano, K. E. (2019). Item response models for multiple attempts. Journal of Educational Measurement, 56, 415-436.
	
Unfortunately, the code is a bit old and was never fully documented, so it's available here, but you'll have to figure it out. Email yoav dot bergner at nyu dot edu if you have questions.
