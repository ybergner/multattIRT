Description: Data from cognitive or psychomotor assessments may be of a
    polytomous nature reflecting multiple attempts made at each item. There are
    several approaches to modeling such data using sequential or polytmous item
    response theory (IRT) models. Several of those are included in this package
    along with data manipulation and transformation functions.
